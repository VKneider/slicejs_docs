# What is Slice.js?

Slice.js is a lightweight, component-based framework built on Web Components and plain JavaScript.
It focuses on clarity, modularity, and fast development without a build pipeline.

## Core Principles
- **Native Web Standards**: Uses browser APIs directly (Custom Elements, templates, DOM).
- **Component-First**: UI is assembled from reusable components with clear props.
- **Zero Build**: Run in the browser without transpilers or heavy tooling.
- **Explicit Lifecycle**: `init`, `update`, and `beforeDestroy` keep component logic predictable.

## What You Build
- UI components with templates and CSS
- Routed views with route containers
- Services for data access and state

## When to Choose Slice.js
- You want a small, understandable framework
- You prefer native APIs over heavy abstractions
- You need quick iteration without build steps
